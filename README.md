# AlgoVisualizer

Algo Visualizer is a web application built with React that allows users to visualize path-finding algorithms to find the shortest path between two points on a grid. It provides an interactive and educational way to understand how these algorithms work.

## Demo 

You can access a live demo of AlgoVisualizer at https://abuuer.github.io/algoVisualizer.

## Features

* Visualize Dijkstra's Algorithm. (Other algorithms to be added soon)
* Start and finish can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the grid.
* Real-time visualization of the algorithm's progress.
* Clear grid and start a new visualization anytime.

## Usage

1. Open the AlgoVisualizer web application in your browser.
3. Drag-and-drop the start and finish icons to different cells.
2. Place obstacles on the grid by clicking on the cells. Obstacles represent areas that the algorithm cannot pass through.
4. Click the "Visualize" button to start the algorithm. Observe how the algorithm finds the shortest path from the start to the finish icons.
5. To start a new visualization, click the "Restart" button and repeat the process.
